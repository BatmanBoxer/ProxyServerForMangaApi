# ProxyServerForMangaApi
Proxy Server
This one it pretty simple
--it just has one query and no end point and returns a image which you provide the url to
This is espically made for my other api but may have other use cases

                      To Install loclly
                      git clone https://github.com/BatmanBoxer/ProxyServerForMangaApi
                      cd to that folder 
                      npm install
                      
                      How to Use
                      http://localhost:1112/?url={url of image}
                      btw this bypasses cloulflare on manganeto image protection

                      Example 
                      http://localhost:1112/?url=https://v2.mkklcdnv6tempv2.com/img/tab_2/00/13/32/ng952689/chapter_700_5_uzumaki_naruto/1-o.jpg
